A WoW 1.12.1 addon for Turtle WoW - Filters Hardcore level up and death messages that are below a certain level.

This addon by default will filter any system messages about hardcore characters leveling up or dying that are below level 20.
If you want to filter messages from higher levels, you will need to manually edit the code.
